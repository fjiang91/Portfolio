***REACTO***

**Repeat**:
There are some chips, and the i-th chip is at position chips[i].

You can perform any of the two following types of moves any number of times (possibly zero) on any chip:

Move the i-th chip by 2 units to the left or to the right with a cost of 0.
Move the i-th chip by 1 unit to the left or to the right with a cost of 1.
There can be two or more chips at the same position initially.

Return the minimum cost needed to move all the chips to the same position (any position).

*Edge Case / Questions to Ask*
* Just to confirm, it will be the value within each individual array that represents the chips[i] index and not the array[i] index?
* Will there be duplicate values with the same position? For Example, [1,1,2]

**Example**:
> **Input**:
> chips = [2,4,5]
>
> **Output**: 1
> <pre>
> 2 -> 4 or 4 -> 2 = 0
> 5 -> 4 or 5 -> 2 = 1
> Output = 1
> </pre>

**Approach**:
1. First Approach -> Brute Force -> 
* We first create a map of the chip's position along with their number of counts and remove duplicates
* Then, we iterate over the chip with the current chip and check the amount needed to move all chips to the current index
* We know that if their difference is odd, then we need to add 1 to the count, or 0 if they're odd (same applies for even)
* Repeat process for all chips, and compute the min at the end of each loop
If no swaps are made, then we have our final result

2. Second Approach -> Optimize -> 
* Since we know that they're two types of values within the array, odd and even.
* We'll need to move the minimum of the two, either all odds to even, or all evens to odd to achieve the minimum count.
* Return the minimum of the two

**Code**: Brute Force
```javascript
var minCostToMoveChips = function(chips) {
    let map = {};
    for (let i = 0; i < chips.length; i++){
        map[chips[i]] = (map[chips[i]] || 0) + 1;
    }
    let uniqueChips = Object.keys(map);
    let minCount = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < uniqueChips.length; i++){
        let currMin = 0;
        let currNum = Number(uniqueChips[i]);
        for (let j = 0; j < uniqueChips.length; j++){
            let compareNum = Number(uniqueChips[j])
            let diff = Math.abs(currNum - compareNum)
            if (i !== j && diff % 2 === 1) {
                currMin += map[compareNum];
            };
        }
        minCount = Math.min(minCount, currMin);
    }
    
    return minCount === Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER ? 0 : minCount;
};
```

**Test**: Unit Testing with Jasmine
```javascript
describe('minCostToMoveChips -> Return the minimum cost needed to move all the chips to the same position (any position).', () => {
  it ('chips = [2,3,4]', () => {
    const output = 1;
    const result = minCostToMoveChips([2,3,4]);
    expect(result).toEqual(output);
  });

  it('chips = [2,4,6]', () => {
    const output = 0;
    const result = minCostToMoveChips([2,4,6]);
    expect(result).toEqual(output);
  });

  it('chips = [2,2,2,5,5]', () => {
    const output = 2;
    const result = minCostToMoveChips([2,2,2,5,5]);
    expect(result).toEqual(output);
  });
});
```

**Optimize**: Code Inspired by Others
```javascript
var minCostToMoveChips = function(chips) {
    let even = 0;
    let odd = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < chips.length; i++){
        if (chips[i] % 2 === 0) even++;
        else odd++
    }
    
    return Math.min(even, odd);
};
```

**Big O**

**Time Complexity**: O(N) -> One Loop

**Space Complexity**: O(1) -> Even/Odd Counter
