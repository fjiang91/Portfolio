***REACTO***

**Repeat**:
In a gold mine grid of size m * n, each cell in this mine has an integer representing the amount of gold in that cell, 0 if it is empty.

Return the maximum amount of gold you can collect under the conditions:

* Every time you are located in a cell you will collect all the gold in that cell.
* From your position you can walk one step to the left, right, up or down.
* You can't visit the same cell more than once.
* Never visit a cell with 0 gold.
* You can start and stop collecting gold from any position in the grid that has some gold.

**Constraints**:
* There are at most 25 cells containing gold.
* 1 <= grid.length, grid[i].length <= 15
* 0 <= grid[i][j] <= 100

**Example**:
> **Input**:
> grid = 
> [[0,6,0],
>  [5,8,7],
>  [0,9,0]]
>
> **Output**: 24
> <pre>
> 9 + 8 + 7
> Output = 24
> </pre>

**Approach**:
1. First Approach ->
* Since we're dealing with a grid, we can utilize a DFS/BFS approach.
* However, since the problem stated the maximum amount, a DFS approach might be better.
* Since the start of the maximum path, might be anywhere on the grid.
* We'll need to apply DFS on every single cell on grid that have a value > 0
* Apply recursion and backtracking to mark node as currently visited while traversing the grid
* Return the maximum count from all four sides

**Code**:
```javascript
var getMaximumGold = function(grid) {
    let maxGold = 0;
    
    for (let row = 0; row < grid.length; row++) {
        for (let col = 0; col < grid[0].length; col++){
            if (grid[row][col] !== 0) {
                maxGold = Math.max(maxGold, goldHelper(grid, row, col, 0));
            }
        }
    }
    
    return maxGold;
};

function goldHelper (grid, row, col, currGold) {
    if (row >= grid.length || row < 0 || col < 0 || col >= grid[0].length || grid[row][col] === 0) {
        return currGold;
    }
    
    let newGold = grid[row][col] + currGold
    let temp = grid[row][col]
    grid[row][col] = 0;
    
    let left = goldHelper(grid, row, col - 1, newGold);
    let right = goldHelper(grid, row, col + 1, newGold);
    let top = goldHelper(grid, row - 1, col, newGold);
    let bottom = goldHelper(grid, row + 1, col, newGold);
    
    grid[row][col] = temp

    return Math.max(left, right, top, bottom);
};
```

**Test**: Unit Testing with Jasmine
```javascript
describe('getMaximumGold -> Return the maximum amount of gold you can collect.', () => {
  it ('grid = [[0,6,0],[5,8,7],[0,9,0]]', () => {
    const output = 24;
    const result = getMaximumGold([[0,6,0],[5,8,7],[0,9,0]]);
    expect(result).toEqual(output);
  });

  it('grid = [[0,6,0],[5,8,7],[0,9,0],[4,6,7],[3,8,9]]', () => {
    const output = 61;
    const result = getMaximumGold([2,4,6]);
    expect(result).toEqual(output);
  });

  it('grid = [[0,6,0],[5,8,7],[0,0,0],[4,6,7]]', () => {
    const output = 21;
    const result = getMaximumGold([[0,6,0],[5,8,7],[0,0,0],[4,6,7]]);
    expect(result).toEqual(output);
  });
});
```

**Optimize**: N/A

**Big O**

**Time Complexity**: O(4 ^ (n * m) (Might be incorrect)) -> Four directions for each cell, however, can go at max 25 cells within the grid stated by the problem

**Space Complexity**: O(n * m) -> Recursion Stack
