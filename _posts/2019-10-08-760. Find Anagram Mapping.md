***REACTO***

**Repeat**:
Given two lists Aand B, and B is an anagram of A. B is an anagram of A means B is made by randomizing the order of the elements in A.

We want to find an index mapping P, from A to B. A mapping P[i] = j means the ith element in A appears in B at index j.

**Note**:
* These lists A and B may contain duplicates. If there are multiple answers, output any of them.

**Example**:
> **Input**:
> A = [1,2,3]
> B = [2,1,3]
> **Output**: [1,0,2]
> <pre>
> A[0] -> Mapped To -> B[1] -> Output -> [1]
> A[1] -> Mapped To -> B[0] -> Output -> [1,0]
> A[2] -> Mapped To -> B[2] -> Output -> [1,0,2]
> </pre>

**Approach**:
1. First Approach ->
* We can create a HashMap with key as the value and value as the index -> {'1': 0}
* Since, we can return any index for duplicate values, I took the approach to just overwrite the existing index and keep the last index
* Iterate through the A array and retrieve the index of the value within B HashMap

**Code**:
```javascript
var anagramMappings = function(A, B) {
    let bMap = {};
    for (let i = 0; i < B.length; i++){
        bMap[B[i]] = i;
    };

    return A.map( num => bMap[num]);
};
```

**Test**: Unit Testing with Jasmine
```javascript
describe('anagramMappings -> Return an array of corresponding index mapping from A to B', () => {
  it ("A = [1,2,3], B = [2,1,3]", () => {
    const output = [1,0,2];
    const result = anagramMappings([1,2,3],[2,1,3]);
    expect(result).toEqual(output);
  });

  it("A = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8], B = [2,1,3,6,8,7,5,4]' , maxCost = 2", () => {
    const output = [1,0,2,7,6,3,5,4];
    const result = anagramMappings([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8],[2,1,3,6,8,7,5,4]);
    expect(result).toEqual(output);
  });

  it("A = [1,1,2,2], B = [2,1,2,1]' , maxCost = 0", () => {
    const output = [3,3,2,2];
    const result = anagramMappings([1,1,2,2], [2,1,2,1]);
    expect(result).toEqual(output);
  });
});
```

**Optimize**: N/A

**Big O**

**Time Complexity**: O(N) -> 2 * O(N) loops

**Space Complexity**: O(N) -> HashMap of B
