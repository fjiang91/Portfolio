***REACTO***

**Repeat**:
Given a forest, return the minimum number of steps necessary to cut all of the trees in order of their height. Return -1 if not possible.

Please refer to the [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/cut-off-trees-for-golf-event/) website for detailed description of the Problem

**Example**:
> **Input**:
> [[10,6,0],
>  [5,8,7],
>  [0,9,0]]
> **Output**: 10
> <pre>
> Start From 0, 0
> Next Largest is 5 -> 0, 0 to 1, 0 -> 1 Step
> Next Largest is 6 -> 1, 0 to 0, 1 -> 2 Steps
> Next Largest is 7 -> 0, 1 to 1, 2 -> 2 Steps
> Next Largest is 8 -> 1, 2 to 1, 1 -> 1 Step
> Next Largest is 9 -> 1, 1 to 2, 1 -> 1 Step
> Next Largest is 10 -> 2, 1 to 0, 0 -> 3 Steps
> Total Steps -> 10
> </pre>

**Approach**:
1.Approach -> BFS
* Since we need to cut the tree by order. We can create a queue of all trees within the forest and sort them
* Loop through the queue in order (based on height) starting from 0, 0 and
* Calculate the minimum distance using BFS from the current X, Y to the next X, Y
* If path does not exist, then we can return -1

**Code**:
```javascript
var cutOffTree = function(forest) {
  //Populate the queue and sort the queue based on tree height
  //We need to cut the tree in order based on problem description
  let queue = populateQueue(forest);
  queue.sort( (a,b) => a[0] - b[0]);

  let currX = 0;
  let currY = 0;
  let stepCount = 0;

  //Loop through the queue, calculate to get from curr X,Y to next X,Y with BFS helper function
  //If the path is not possible, then return -1
  while(queue.length) {
      let next = queue.shift();
      let nextX = next[1];
      let nextY = next[2];
      let steps = stepToNext(forest, currX, currY, nextX, nextY);
      if (steps === - 1) return -1;

      stepCount += steps;
      currX = nextX;
      currY = nextY;
  };

  return stepCount;
};

//BFS Helper function to calculate to get from source X,Y
//To target X,Y and return the minimum step required for this operation
//If path don't exist, return -1
function stepToNext(forest, sourceX, sourceY, targetX, targetY) {
  let seem = {};
  let queue = [[sourceX, sourceY, 0]];
  let fourDirection = [[0,1],[0, -1], [1, 0], [-1, 0]]

  while (queue.length) {
      let [currX, currY, currStep] = queue.shift();

      if (currX === targetX && currY === targetY) return currStep;

      //Check if currX and currY is visited
      let cell = currX + '-' + currY;
      if (seem[cell]) continue;
      seem[cell] = true

      //Calculate the possible neightbors
      for (let i = 0; i < fourDirection.length; i++) {
          let [row, col] = fourDirection[i];
          let newX = currX + row;
          let newY = currY + col;
          //Make sure newX and newY is within forest boundary
          if (newX < 0 || newX >= forest.length || newY < 0 || newY >= forest[0].length || forest[newX][newY] <= 0) continue;

          queue.push([newX, newY, currStep + 1]);
      };
  };

  return -1;
};

//Helper function to populate the queue with the individual tree within the forest
function populateQueue (forest) {
  let queue = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < forest.length; i++) {
      for (let j = 0; j < forest[0].length; j++){
          if (forest[i][j] > 0) {
              queue.push([forest[i][j], i, j]);
          }
      }
  }
  return queue;
};
```

**Test**: Unit Testing with Jasmine
```javascript
describe('cutOffTree -> Return the minimum number of steps to cut all trees', () => {
  it ('forest = [[10,6,0],[5,8,7],[0,9,0]]', () => {
    const output = 10;
    const result = cutOffTree([[10,6,0],[5,8,7],[0,9,0]]);
    expect(result).toEqual(output);
  });

  it('forest = [[10,6,17],[5,8,7],[0,9,0],[11,15,0]]', () => {
    const output = 20;
    const result = cutOffTree([[10,6,17],[5,8,7],[0,9,0],[11,15,0]]);
    expect(result).toEqual(output);
  });

  it('forest = [[10,6,17],[5,8,7],[0,0,0],[11,15,0]]', () => {
    const output = -1;
    const result = cutOffTree([[10,6,17],[5,8,7],[0,0,0],[11,15,0]]);
    expect(result).toEqual(output);
  });
});
```

**Optimize**: Please refer to LeetCode Website for A* Search and Hadlock's Algorithm

**Big O**

**Time Complexity**: O((N * M) ^ 2) -> Worst Case Scenario -> we'll have to go from one end of the forest to the other end to cut the next largest tree at each step

**Space Complexity**: O(N * M) -> Forest Size
