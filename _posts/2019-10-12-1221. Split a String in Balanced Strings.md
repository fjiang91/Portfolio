***REACTO***

**Repeat**:
Balanced strings are those who have equal quantity of 'L' and 'R' characters.

Given a balanced string s split it in the maximum amount of balanced strings.

Return the maximum amount of splitted balanced strings.

*Edge Case / Questions to Ask*
* Will the string only consist of L and R?
* Is it guaranteed that the string will be balanced? No extra R or L?
<!--more-->

**Example**:
> **Input**:
> RLRLRLLLRR
> **Output**: 4
> <pre>
> RL -> [0,1]
> RL -> [2,3]
> RL -> [4,5]
> LLRR -> [6,9]
> </pre>

**Approach**:
First Approach
* We can generate the pair using two counter l and r.
* When the two counter is greater than 0, and equal to each other
* Then, we have found a pair
* Continue the process until index is out of bound

Second Approach
* Have a l counter that keeps track increase or decrease depending on which char we hit
* If L -> +1, else R -> -1
* If at any point, the counter is zero, then we have found a balance

**Code**:
```javascript
var balancedStringSplit = function(s) {
  let l = 0;
  let r = 0;

  let count = 0;
  let i = 0;

  while( i < s.length ) {
      //Generate the pair
      //Loop until l and r is greater than 0 and they're not equal to each other
      //If equal, then we found a pair and increase count
      while ( (l === 0 && r === 0) || (l !== r && i < s.length)) {
          let char = s[i++];
          if (char === 'L') l++;
          else r++;
      };
      l = 0;
      r = 0;
      count++;
  };

  return count;
};
```

**Test**: Unit Testing with Jasmine
```javascript
describe('balancedStringSplit -> Return the maximum amount of splitted balanced strings.', () => {
  it ("s = 'RLRRLLRL'", () => {
    const output = 3;
    const result = balancedStringSplit('RLRRLLRL');
    expect(result).toEqual(output);
  });

  it("s = 'RL'", () => {
    const output = 1;
    const result = balancedStringSplit('RL');
    expect(result).toEqual(output);
  });

  it("s = 'RLRRRLLLRLRL'", () => {
    const output = 4;
    const result = balancedStringSplit('RLRRRLLLRLRL');
    expect(result).toEqual(output);
  });
});
```

**Optimize**: Code inspired by others
```javascript
var balancedStringSplit = function(s) {
    let l = 0;
    let count = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        l += (s[i] === 'L' ? 1 : -1)
        if (l === 0) count++
    };

    return count;
};
```
**Big O**

**Time Complexity**: O(N) -> L or R counter

**Space Complexity**: O(1)
