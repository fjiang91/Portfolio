***REACTO***

**Repeat**:
Find out the state of the asteroids after all collisions. If two asteroids meet, the smaller one will explode. If both are the same size, both will explode. Two asteroids moving in the same direction will never meet.

Please refer to LeetCode for detailed description of the problem. [LeetCode Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/asteroid-collision/)

*Edge Case / Questions to Ask*s
<!--more-->

**Example**:
> **Input**: nums = [1,-2,3,-4]
> **Output**: 24
> <pre>
> 1 * -2 = -2
> -2 * 3 = -6
> -6 * -4 = 24
> </pre>

**Approach**:
Stack
* Use a stack and keep track of which asteroid we need to keep and which we need to discard according to the rules below (Similar to validate parenthesis problem)
* If a negative asteroid appears before any positive asteroid, then this asteroid will never collide -> [-1,-2,3,-3] -> [-1,-2] will never collide
* Same follows no negative asteroid follows a positive asteroid, then this asteroid will never collide -> [1,-1,3,4] -> [3,4] will never collide
* Two asteroid will collide if the a negative appears after a positive collide -> [1,-3]
* Use a while loop and continue to check if two asteroid will collide, if so,
* Then, remove both if they're the same
* Else, keep the Math.abs of larger num

**Code**:
```javascript
var asteroidCollision = function(asteroids) {
  let stack = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < asteroids.length; i++) {
    let num = asteroids[i];
    stack.push(num);

    /*
    * Make sure there's two values within the stack and check if the last two indexs will collide
    * LastIndex with negative value going left
    * SecondToLastIndex with positve value going right
    */

    while (
      stack.length > 1 &&
      stack[stack.length - 1] < 0 &&
      stack[stack.length - 2] > 0
    ) {
      let lastNum = stack.pop();
      let secondNum = stack.pop();
      let lastAbs = Math.abs(lastNum);
      let secondAbs = Math.abs(secondNum);
      if (secondAbs < lastAbs) {
        stack.push(lastNum);
      } else if (secondNum > lastAbs) {
        stack.push(secondNum);
      } else break;
    }
  }
  return stack;
};
```

**Test**: Unit Testing with Jasmine
```javascript
describe('asteroidCollision -> Find out the state of the asteroids after all collisions. If two asteroids meet, the smaller one will explode. If both are the same size, both will explode. Two asteroids moving in the same direction will never meet.', () => {
  it ("asteroids = [5,10,-5, -10]", () => {
    const output = [5];
    const result = asteroidCollision([5,10,-5,-10]);
    expect(result).toEqual(output);
  });

  it("asteroids = [-5,-10,5,10]", () => {
    const output = [-5,-10,5,10];
    const result = asteroidCollision([-5,-10,5,10]);
    expect(result).toEqual(output);
  });

  it("asteroids = [10,5,-5,-10]", () => {
    const output = [];
    const result = asteroidCollision([10,5,-5,-10]);
    expect(result).toEqual(output);
  });
});
```

**Optimize**:

**Big O**

**Time Complexity**: O(2N) -> At max, push every single num inside and collide it with all nums within the stack -> O(N)

**Space Complexity**: O(N) -> Stack
